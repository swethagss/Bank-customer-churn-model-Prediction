# *Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model*

**Overview**

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank. Customer churn refers to customers leaving or closing their accounts, and predicting churn helps banks take proactive measures to retain their customers. The model aims to classify whether a customer will churn based on several demographic, transactional, and behavioral factors.

**Objectives**

* To predict whether a bank customer is likely to churn using machine learning techniques.
* To explore key features that influence customer churn.
* To improve the bank's customer retention strategies based on predictive insights.

**Dataset**
Features:
* Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
* Age: Age of the customer.
* Gender: Gender of the customer.
* Balance: Account balance of the customer.
* Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
* Products: Number of products the customer has purchased from the bank.
* Has Credit Card: Whether the customer has a credit card.
* Is Active Member: Whether the customer is an active user.
* Estimated Salary: Customer's estimated annual salary.
* Churn: Target variable (0 for no churn, 1 for churn).

**Approach**
1) Data Preprocessing
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3) Modeling
4) Model Evaluation
